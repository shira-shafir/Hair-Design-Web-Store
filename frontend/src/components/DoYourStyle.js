                    How To Dutch Braid Your Hair
                    It’s important to note that Dutch braids can be confused with French braids and cornrows. However,
                    there are significant differences between each style. Think of the Dutch braid as a reversed version
                    of the French braid. Technique-wise, the difference is that you bring the outside strands over the
                    middle section whereas, in a Dutch braid, you bring the outer strands under the middle section. And
                    when creating cornrows, the difference from the other two is in the weaving. Instead of crossing
                    your strands while holding your hair at an angle, you’re going to braid down for a tighter, flatter
                    effect against the scalp.

                    Now that you know the differences between each style of braiding, it’s time to learn how to Dutch
                    braid. Check out our tutorial below, complete with products you can use to create a beautiful braid.

                    Step #1: Clean And Prep Your Hair
                    Of course, you’ll want to start with clean hair to get the best results possible. Use the L’Oréal
                    Paris Everpure Sulfate Free Scalp Care + Detox Shampoo and the L’Oréal Paris Everpure Sulfate Free
                    Scalp Care + Detox Conditioner to help purify your scalp and get rid of any dirt, product build-up,
                    and excess oil. After cleansing, brush through your strands to remove any knots (going from lengths
                    to roots) and add the L'Oréal Paris Advanced Hairstyle BOOST IT Volume Inject Mousse to give your
                    mane texture and body.

                    Step #2: Section Your Hair
                    At your hairline, create a section of hair from eyebrow arch to eyebrow arch. Then apply one to two
                    pumps of the L’Oréal Paris Elvive Dream Lengths Frizz Killer Serum Leave-In. This will help give
                    your hairstyle a sleek and smooth finish. Split this section into three equally-sized strands. This
                    will be the start of your braid.

                    Step #3: Anchor Your Braid
                    To anchor your braid, bring your right strand under the middle strand. Then, bring the left strand
                    under the new middle strand. Gradually add more hair to the left and right strands as you continue
                    to braid.

                    Step #4: Repeat
                    Once you have no more hair to add to your braid, finish by styling the remaining length of your mane
                    into a traditional, loose three-strand plait. Secure the braid with an elastic and complete the
                    style by spritzing your mane with the L'Oréal Paris Elnett Satin Hairspray Strong Hold to help lock
                    the style in place.

                    How To Double Dutch Braid Your Hair
                    While the name may remind you of the game you used to play during recess as a child—there is no
                    correlation between the braid and the game. This double Dutch braid requires a whole different set
                    of skills (and we’d argue it’s way easier to master). Here’s how to do it:

                    Step #1: Brush Your Strands
                    If you’re looking for a way to refresh your trends without shampooing, reach for a dry shampoo like
                    the L'Oréal Paris Elvive Dream Lengths Air Volume Dry Shampoo. Its formula is designed to instantly
                    absorb oil for a long-lasting clean feel with no white residue. Be sure to spritz at the roots to
                    add some texture.

                    Step #2: Section Your Hair And Dutch Braid It
                    Create a middle part down the center of your scalp and split your hair into two even sections.
                    Secure the left side with a hair clip to keep it out of the way. Then start brushing the right side
                    of your hair back (in the direction you’ll be braiding). Grab a small triangle section at the front
                    of your hairline, split it into three sections, and begin Dutch braiding. Bring the right strand
                    under the middle strand, then the left strand under the new middle strand, and continuously add more
                    hair to the strands as you braid.

                    Editor’s Tip: Dutch braiding the back of your head can be tricky, so be sure to use a few mirrors
                    and position yourself in a spot that allows you to see the back of your mane.

                    Step #3: Complete Your Braid
                    Once you’ve run out of hair to add to your braid, finish your Dutch pigtail by putting the remaining
                    length of your mane into a traditional three-strand braid. To add more pizzazz to the look, style
                    your baby hairs using a dime-sized amount of hair gel, like the L’Oréal Paris Advanced Hairstyle
                    LOCK IT Extreme Style Gel and use an edge brush to swoop the hairs into place.

                    Step #4: Repeat On The Other Side
                    Remove the hair clip from the left side of your hair and repeat steps one through three to create a
                    second braid.
